# AppointmentTracking-vb
I've had several requests for the appointment manager source code back when i did this some time ago.
I decided to work on another one that's similar and share the source code.

Getting Started:
Make sure you have LINQ2SQL Class component installed into your Visual Studio.
If you don't have this installed you can do so from your Visual Studio Installer.

Because i am using the Metro Modern Framework, you may need to restore the package from the online version.
Once you open Tools => NuGet Package Manager => Manage NuGet Packages For Solution you should see it installed with a yellow message at the top...click Restore than click on References from your Solution Explorer than click Refresh and you should be good to go.
If you have any issues, just uninstall it and re-install the framework.
install it from your NuGet Package Manager.
Tools => NuGet Package Manager => Manage NuGet Packages For Solution
